compile: make  

Very very simple raytracer draws a sphere on the screen with one light source.
The code really needs some serious cleaning and tidying.?.  
  
 Goal: Do the steps described here: https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki/Part-1:-understandable-raytracing
 
idea:
 - add_pov function which adds the point of view of the scene.
  - multiple objects, spheres? need a tree that can point to any object that can be placed in the world   
  - Integrate CMOCK and UNITY.
